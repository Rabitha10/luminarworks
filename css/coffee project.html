        <p>
            One could argue that the allure of coffee is rooted in its chemistry, an amalgam of elements that provide the flavors and aromas it possesses and the physiological effects it causes. Scientists have identified more than 1,500 chemicals and over 1,000 aroma compounds in your average cup of coffee. This complex brew may be responsible for a wide range of health benefits, including:




A reduced risk of developing type 2 diabetes

Protection from memory loss and dementia associated with Alzheimer’s disease

Protection from some types of liver damage

Enhancement of short-term memory, focus and concentration

A reduced risk of some types of cancer

A short-term increase in energy and stamina
