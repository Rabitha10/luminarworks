        <h3>Khalel Hosaeini</h3>
        <p>Khaled Hosseini (/ˈhɑːlɛd hoʊˈseɪni/; Persian: خالد حسینی [ˈxɒled hoˈsejni]; born 4 March 1965) is an Afghan-American novelist and UNHCR goodwill ambassador.[1][2] His debut novel The Kite Runner (2003) was a critical and commercial success; the book, as well as his subsequent novels, have all been at least partially set in Afghanistan and have featured an Afghan as the protagonist.

            Born in Kabul, Afghanistan, to a diplomat father, Hosseini spent some time living in Iran and France. When Hosseini was 15, his family applied for asylum in the United States, where he later became a naturalized citizen. Hosseini did not return to Afghanistan until 2003[3] when he was 38, an experience similar to that of the protagonist in The Kite Runner. In later interviews, Hosseini admitted to feeling survivor's guilt for having been able to leave the country prior to the Soviet invasion and subsequent wars.</p>
